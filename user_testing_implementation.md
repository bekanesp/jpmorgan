## Test Session Scripts

### Introduction Script
```
Thank you for participating in our user testing session for the JP Morgan Global Markets Summer Analyst interview preparation tool. Today, we'll be asking you to complete several tasks using this tool while sharing your thoughts aloud.

This is not a test of your abilities - we're testing the tool, not you. There are no right or wrong answers, and your honest feedback will help us improve the experience.

We'll be recording this session to review later. All your information will remain confidential and will only be used to improve the tool.

Do you have any questions before we begin?
```

### Task Introduction Template
```
Now I'd like you to [task description]. Please try to complete this task while sharing your thoughts aloud - tell us what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and any questions that come to mind.

Don't worry about making mistakes or getting confused - that helps us identify where we need to make improvements.
```

### Wrap-up Script
```
That concludes our testing tasks. Thank you for your participation and valuable feedback.

Before we finish, I have a few final questions about your overall experience with the tool.

[Ask post-test interview questions]

Thank you again for your time and insights. Your feedback will directly help us improve this interview preparation tool for students like yourself.

## Analysis Templates

### Heatmap Generation Guide
```
1. Collect all click/tap data from testing sessions
2. Normalize coordinates across different screen sizes
3. Generate overlay visualization using the following color scale:
   - Low interaction: Blue
   - Medium interaction: Green
   - High interaction: Yellow
   - Very high interaction: Red
4. Generate separate heatmaps for:
   - Each major screen/view
   - Each user segment (Gen Z vs. others)
   - Each device type
5. Compare expected interaction areas with actual patterns
6. Identify "dead zones" with minimal interaction
```
